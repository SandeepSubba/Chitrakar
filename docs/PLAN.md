# Chitrakar — Architecture & Roadmap

Chitrakar ("painter") is a modern, multiplatform photo + vector editing app built around
two non-negotiable principles:

1. **Non-destructive everything** — the document is a tree of live objects (shapes,
   images, adjustments, filters, masks). Pixels are only ever *rendered*, never baked.
   Any edit can be revisited or removed at any time.
2. **Real color management** — documents can be RGB or CMYK, with ICC-profile-correct
   import, display (soft proofing), and export. This is designed into the pixel
   pipeline from day one, not bolted on.

**Target platforms:** Windows, macOS, Linux, iPadOS, iOS, Android.

## 0. Where things stand (read this first)

*Handoff block — keep it current; it exists so a fresh session can resume
without reading anything else.*

- **Branch:** `claude/multiplatform-photo-vector-editor-enghs5`.
- **Working today:** a real editor. Draw rects/ellipses/pen paths (straight
  or smooth), place images, add live text; move/scale with handles and live
  drag preview; adjustment layers (exposure, brightness/contrast, hue/sat),
  filter layers (gaussian blur, sharpen), masks on any layer, groups,
  reorder, opacity/blend, rename, labelled history with jump-to-state.
  Color: embedded ICC honored on import, CMYK documents with press profiles,
  soft proofing + gamut warning. Files: `.chitra` save/open; export PNG, SVG,
  CMYK TIFF. Desktop app packages (deb verified locally; CI builds
  Win/macOS/Linux installers on a `v*` tag).
- **Verify before committing:** `cargo test --workspace` (~75),
  `cargo clippy --workspace --all-targets -- -D warnings`, `cargo fmt --all`,
  and in `app/`: `npm run build && npm run test:e2e` (~81 browser
  assertions). Both suites self-skip CMYK-profile steps unless
  `CHITRAKAR_TEST_CMYK_ICC` points at a CMYK .icc.
- **Next up (rough priority):**
  1. PDF export (composite + embedded profile) — the last export gap.
  2. wgpu/vello GPU backend, validated pixel-for-pixel against the CPU
     reference renderer (llvmpipe makes this CI-able — see
     docs/spikes/gpu-rendering.md).
  3. Mobile shells: `tauri android init` / `ios init` (needs SDKs, so it
     wants a machine with Xcode/Android Studio).
  4. Depth: bezier handles on paths, brush engine, gradient fills, text
     shaping via rustybuzz/parley.
- **Tooling:** `tools/chitrakar-plugin/` is a Claude Code plugin bundling
  the verification gate, status, ship, the engine conventions skill, and a
  SessionStart hook (install: `/plugin marketplace add
  SandeepSubba/Chitrakar`, `/plugin install chitrakar@chitrakar`).
- **Known limits, deliberately:** no anti-aliasing in the CPU rasterizer
  (the GPU path brings it), transforms carry scale+translate only (no
  rotation/shear yet), masks aren't editable on-canvas, PDF/JPEG export
  missing.

## 1. Tech stack

| Piece | Choice | Why |
|---|---|---|
| Engine | **Rust** (`chitrakar-core` workspace) | Memory-safe, fast, compiles natively for all 6 targets *and* to WASM; one engine codebase forever. |
| App shell | **Tauri 2** | Single shell framework covering desktop *and* iOS/Android; native menus, file dialogs, small binaries. |
| UI | **TypeScript + React** (webview) | One UI codebase across all platforms; responsive layout adapts desktop ⇄ tablet ⇄ phone. |
| GPU rendering | **wgpu** (vectors via **vello**, raster ops via compute shaders) | Portable over Vulkan/Metal/DX12/GLES — and over WebGPU when the engine runs as WASM. |
| Color management | **ICC-based CMS**: `lcms2` (battle-tested) with `moxcms` (pure Rust) evaluated as the WASM-friendly alternative | Correct RGB/CMYK conversions, monitor profiles, soft proofing. |
| Codecs | `image`/`zune` crates (PNG, JPEG, TIFF), `resvg`/`usvg` (SVG import), custom exporters | Pure Rust ⇒ works on every target including WASM. |

### How the engine reaches the screen

The engine is one Rust crate compiled two ways:

- **WASM build (MVP path):** the engine runs *inside* the webview and renders through
  WebGPU (fallback: WebGL2/canvas readback). UI ⇄ engine calls are plain in-process
  bindings — no IPC serialization on the hot path. This works identically in every
  Tauri shell and keeps one render path to debug.
- **Native build (optimization path, later):** the same crate runs in the Tauri host
  process rendering with wgpu directly to a native surface composited with the webview.
  We switch per-platform only where WASM/WebGPU proves insufficient (likely candidates:
  older Android webviews, very large documents).

**Risk to validate first (Phase 0 spike):** WebGPU availability in each platform's
webview (WKWebView on iOS, Android System WebView, WebView2, WebKitGTK). The fallback
ladder (WebGL2 → software render + blit) must be proven before we commit the MVP to it.

## 2. Document model (the heart of the app)

```
Document
├─ metadata: color mode (RGB | CMYK), working profile, dpi, dimensions
├─ resources: embedded source images (immutable, content-addressed)
└─ root: Group
   ├─ VectorObject      — path/shape parameters, fills, strokes (all editable)
   ├─ RasterObject      — reference to immutable source pixels + its own
   │                       non-destructive edit stack (crop, transform, adjustments)
   ├─ AdjustmentLayer   — curves, levels, HSL, exposure… applies to everything below
   ├─ FilterEffect      — gaussian blur, sharpen… attached to an object or a group
   ├─ Group             — nesting, blend mode, opacity, clipping
   └─ Mask              — raster or vector mask attachable to any node
```

Key rules:

- **Source pixels are immutable.** A RasterObject points at a resource; edits are
  parameter stacks evaluated at render time.
- **Rendering is a pull-based graph evaluation** with per-node caching: a node re-renders
  only when its parameters or inputs change. Caches are tiled (e.g. 256×256 tiles) so
  editing one region doesn't invalidate the whole canvas.
- **Edits are commands.** Every mutation goes through a command object → free undo/redo,
  and later a path to collaborative editing (commands are serializable).
- **Working pixel format:** 32-bit float, premultiplied, linear light, in the document's
  working space. Blending happens in linear; display transform is the last step.

### File format: `.chitra`

A ZIP container (same family as `.ora`/`.sketch`):

```
document.chitra
├─ manifest.json     — versioned schema: full node tree + parameters
├─ resources/        — original embedded images, untouched bytes
├─ profiles/         — embedded ICC profiles
└─ thumbnails/       — preview renders
```

Human-diffable manifest, originals preserved byte-for-byte, forward-compatible via
schema version + "unknown node" passthrough (unknown future node types survive
open→save round trips).

---

## 3. Color pipeline (RGB + CMYK)

No GPU API understands CMYK — so the CMS is part of the engine, not the platform.

```
import:  decode → assign/honor embedded ICC profile → convert to working space
edit:    all compositing in linear float, working space
display: working space → monitor profile (or soft-proof: working → CMYK press
         profile → monitor, with gamut warning overlay)
export:  working space → target profile (sRGB PNG/JPEG, CMYK TIFF/PDF), profile embedded
```

- **RGB documents:** working space = linear form of the chosen profile (sRGB default;
  Display P3 / Adobe RGB selectable).
- **CMYK documents:** native CMYK values are preserved on objects where they were
  authored (a "C:100 M:0 Y:0 K:0" fill stays those numbers); compositing happens in a
  linear RGB proxy space with the document's press profile (e.g. FOGRA39, GRACoL)
  driving display and export. This is the Affinity/Photoshop-style compromise that keeps
  editing fast *and* output correct.
- Soft proofing and per-document rendering intent (perceptual/relative colorimetric)
  are first-class UI, not buried settings.

## 4. Repository layout

```

├─ core/                  # Rust workspace
│  ├─ doc/                # document model, commands, undo, .chitra I/O

## 5. Roadmap

### Phase 0 — Foundations & risk spikes (small)
- ✅ Scaffold Rust workspace, Tauri 2 app, React UI, CI (fmt/clippy/test + desktop builds).
- ✅ Desktop packaging: app icons generated for every platform, bundling enabled
  (deb/rpm/AppImage, dmg, msi/nsis), a Linux .deb built and inspected locally,
  and a release workflow producing installers for Windows, macOS (Intel +
  Apple Silicon), and Linux on version tags or manual dispatch.
- **Spike 1:** WASM engine + WebGPU triangle→texture inside Tauri webview on desktop,
  iOS Simulator, Android emulator. Decide the fallback ladder with data.
  - ✅ *First half proven:* engine compiles to WASM (wasm-bindgen), runs in-browser,
    renders to canvas via `putImageData`; full editor loop (draw/undo/hide/save)
    verified headless in Chromium. WebGPU-in-webview per platform still open.
  - ✅ *Native wgpu proven headless* (docs/spikes/gpu-rendering.md): wgpu 23 on
    llvmpipe software Vulkan renders pixel-correct at ~3ms per 1280×720
    draw+readback — the GPU backend is developable and CI-testable against
    the CPU reference renderer.
- **Spike 2:** ✅ lcms2 vs moxcms — **moxcms chosen** (compiles to wasm where
  lcms2's C core cannot, ~4.4× faster, matches lcms2 within 1/255 on RGB and
  CMYK press-profile transforms). Full numbers: docs/spikes/color-management.md.

### Phase 1 — Core editor (vector + raster objects)
- ✅ Document model, command/undo system, `.chitra` save/load (manifest-only container;
  embedded resources arrive with raster support).
- Cached incremental rendering ✅: the engine keeps a composite cache, computes
  dirty regions from node bounds per command, and re-renders/re-encodes only
  those pixels (adjustment layers dirty everything below, by design). Per-node
  tile caches refine this later. Canvas pan/zoom ✅ (wheel zoom toward cursor,
  space/middle-drag pan, fit-to-window).
- Live gestures ✅: preview/commit/cancel in the engine — drags update the
  document each pointer move, history records one undo step per gesture,
  Escape cancels. Transforms support scale (shear/rotation with the GPU path).
- Vector: rect/ellipse ✅ drawn interactively; polygon paths ✅ — even-odd
  fill, centered stroke for open polylines (line art), hit testing and
  stroke-aware bounds — drawn with the pen tool ✅ (click anchors, click the
  first anchor to close as a filled shape, Enter finishes an open stroked
  path, Escape abandons, dashed live preview). Bezier segments and anchor
  editing pending; gradient fills pending.
- Raster: place PNG/JPEG as RasterObject ✅ (content-addressed resource pool,
  pixels embedded as PNGs in .chitra, undoable placement, move + hit test);
  scale/rotate pending.
- Layer panel: hide ✅, select ✅, delete ✅, reorder ✅ (MoveNode command:
  reorder + reparent with subtree-cycle protection), opacity slider ✅,
  blend-mode picker ✅; grouping UI pending.
- Selection ✅ (hit test + move tool with live preview); corner resize
  handles ✅ (anchored scaling); rotation handles pending.

### Phase 2 — Non-destructive power
- Adjustment layers: brightness/contrast ✅, exposure ✅, hue/saturation ✅
  (feColorMatrix-style hue rotation + luminance-relative saturation) — all
  re-editable via the properties panel with live slider preview, one undo
  step per gesture. Levels and curves pending.
- Vector styling ✅ first pass: fill and inner stroke (color + width),
  editable on existing objects; stroke-only shapes hit-test on the band.
  Gradients pending. Layer rename ✅ (SetName command, inline edit).
- Filter effects: gaussian blur ✅ and sharpen (unsharp mask) ✅ as
  non-destructive layers — CPU path uses three iterated box blurs
  (O(pixels) per pass, W3C feGaussianBlur approximation) in premultiplied
  linear; parameters live-edit via the panel. While any filter layer exists,
  incremental invalidation falls back to whole-canvas (neighborhood reads at
  region edges); padded region rendering and the GPU compute path refine
  this later.
- Masks ✅ first pass: a mask attaches to any node — vector masks (hard shape
  coverage) and raster masks (luminance × alpha, transform-sampled) modulate
  a shape's/image's paint, a group's composite, and an adjustment's or
  filter's strength; invert supported; UI adds an inscribed ellipse mask
  with invert/remove. Paintable raster masks await the brush engine;
  on-canvas mask geometry editing and clipping groups pending.
- Full undo/redo history panel ✅: every edit records a human-readable label
  (from the forward command and the touched layer's name); the panel lists
  past and undone-future edits and clicking jumps the document to that point.
- Grouping ✅: Batch command (atomic multi-command with rollback, one undo
  step); group ctrl-click-selected same-parent layers into a new group,
  ungroup dissolves in place — both single history entries.

### Phase 3 — Color management & export
- ICC import honoring embedded profiles ✅ (PNG/JPEG pixels tagged with an
  RGB profile normalize to sRGB at the decode edge via moxcms).
- CMYK document mode ✅ with press profiles ✅: documents carry an ICC press
  profile (persisted in .chitra as profiles/cmyk.icc, loadable in the UI);
  authored CMYK ink renders through it, naive formula as fallback; shapes
  drawn in CMYK documents author real ink values with C/M/Y/K ink sliders ✅.
- Soft proofing ✅ + gamut warning ✅: display-only round trip through the
  press profile at the presentation-encode step (exports stay unproofed);
  out-of-gamut pixels mark neutral grey. Monitor profiles and rendering-
  intent selection pending.
- Export: PNG ✅ (sRGB composite), SVG ✅ (live vector markup — shapes,
  paths, groups with opacity/blend, embedded rasters, text; CMYK colors
  resolve through the press profile; adjustments/filters/masks noted as
  omitted), CMYK TIFF ✅ (composite separated into ink through the press
  profile, composited over paper white, 4-channel TIFF with that profile
  embedded; refuses rather than guessing when no profile is loaded).
  JPEG and PDF pending.

### Phase 4 — Mobile shells
- Tauri iOS/Android builds; responsive UI: collapsible panels → bottom toolbars.
- Touch + Apple Pencil/stylus input (pressure into the input pipeline early, ahead of
  brush tools).
- Platform file integration (Files app, Android SAF, share sheets).

### Phase 5 — Depth (ongoing)
- Pen tool + full path editing; boolean operations on shapes.
- Text objects ✅ first pass: live TextSpec nodes (string, size, color as
  document state; glyphs rasterize at render time via ab_glyph + bundled
  DejaVu Sans, kerned per-glyph layout with newline support), blitted through
  the node transform with mask/opacity/blend support; Text tool click-places,
  panel edits content/size/color with gesture preview; resize handles work.
  Proper shaping (`rustybuzz`/`parley`), font choice, and weights pending.
- Brush engine for raster painting; healing/clone as non-destructive ops.
- Live effects (drop shadow, outline), styles, symbols/components.
- Later bets enabled by the architecture: collaboration (serializable commands),
  plugin API (WASM sandboxed), web build (engine already compiles to WASM).

## 6. Guiding decisions (mini-ADRs)

1. **One engine, two compilations (WASM + native)** — never fork the engine per platform.
2. **Linear float compositing** — correctness first; 8-bit preview paths only as a
   measured optimization.
3. **Tiled, cached, pull-based rendering** — the non-negotiable for non-destructive
   editing at interactive speed.
4. **Immutable sources + parameter stacks + commands** — undo, history, and future
   collaboration all fall out of this one choice.
5. **ZIP+JSON container format** — inspectable, versionable, resilient; binary-only
   formats are a trap at this stage.
6. **UI in the webview, pixels in the engine** — the UI never touches pixel buffers;
   it sends commands and displays engine-rendered textures.
